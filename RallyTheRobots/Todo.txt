Create unittests for only new things and bugs! //(everything start with input checker (Use MouseState, GamePadState and KeyboardState (in a new InputState object?) to be able to test))
x Remove RollingState2 and RollingState2Character. Don't know what they where planned to be used for. Probably they where planned for when control-buttons can be configured?
x Refactor ButtonAreaImage
x Add suffix string that is used for RollingStateCharacter-images
Bug list:
Maybe this is the bug bellow, but when entering the game there is no block when exiting the splash with mouse button. You can hit the menu continue directly.
x Button down for ScreenChangeOnAnyKey doesn´t block until key up (keyboard enter and gamepad especially) (Used in splash screen).
